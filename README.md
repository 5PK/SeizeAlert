# Mohawk College Software Project

This app reads a sample csv file representing sensor modules and detects whether the user is having a seizure or not.

## SeizeAlert

This is a template app generated by Expo and React Native. The Documentation can be found here https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started

In order to test this app, you will need the following

- Have Git installed.

- Access to a UNIX terminal. Git Bash on Windows.

- Have NPM installed https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

- Have Expo installed 'npm install -g expo-cli'

- Have a mobile emulator installed. This comes default with the Android SDK when installing Android Studio if you're debugging on an Android Device.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Enter the project directory
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Start the mobile device emulation. You can do this through Android Studio's AVD manager. 
5. Change directory to the Client folder.   
5. Run 'npm start' This will start the app. Notice the 'Run on Android device' button. 
6. Click 'Run on Android device' on the app, this will start the app on the emulation

Alternatively, use expo on your physical android or ios device and copy the QR code to run the app.

## Documentation

This app uses the following libraries

- react-native ( https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial )

    This is the core of the application

- react-navigation ( https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html )

    This is what we'll use to handle routing the pages in the app

- react-native-elements ( https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/overview.html )

    This is what we'll use to style the application

- Other Resources

    This guy, his videos are based on barebones React. We're using EXPO so our system will be different, but the information is still relevant -> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWBrqglnjNl2yaCcp0HEAWp6zBIfingZ-



## Notes

The benefits of using React Native over Native Android

- Cross platform ios/android
- Live debugging
- Lightweight
- Industry Standard for rapid development
