# Prototype Seizure Alert Mobile Application

Using previous research completed by a different team, this is the next step in creating a solution for epilepsy patients. This
application is a Full Stack solution which provides the possibility of extending functionality for a variety of use cases

1. Clinical Trials
2. Alert System for Primary Care providers
3. Tracking Seizure History
4. Any Data Collection based on acceleration movement (fall detector comes to mind)

## Functionality

1. Gather Data from BLE sensor tags
2. Uses a rudimentary algorithm to detect a 'seizure'
3. Seizure history from a web portal
4. Headless Task on Android, runs in the background

## Limitations

1. Sensor tag polling rate
2. IOS not supported
3. Better detection algorithm required
